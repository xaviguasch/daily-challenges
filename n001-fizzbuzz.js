// Given a number as an input, print out every integer from 1 to that number. However, when the integer is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz”; when it’s divisible by 5, print out “Buzz”; when it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “Fizz Buzz”.

// Hint: Loop with conditionals that use modulus

const fizzBuzz = (number) => {
  return
}

console.log(fizzBuzz(5))
console.log(fizzBuzz(16))
console.log(fizzBuzz(28))
